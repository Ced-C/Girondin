# Girondin
A Kanata config to make the most use of your keyboard. Heavily inspired by (Arsenik)[https://github.com/fabi1cazenave/arsenik]. 

On a normal keyboard, people who touch-type _only_ use 9 fingers. 
This project aims to fix it and provide a good setup to use 10 fingers and thus improve the typing experience —even on a laptop keyboard. 

Some choices have been made to maximize comfort, sometime at the expense of speed. 

This setup has been used along with the [Bépolar layout](https://github.com/Ced-C/Bepolar). 

# Key Features
- 3 layer-tap keys under the thumbs: Shift/Backspace, Navigation/Space, Delete/AltGr
- tap-mods on the 3×10 + `5` comfortable keys (assuming the spacebar is not too long, `Super, Alt, Space, AltGr, Compose` can be accessed by thumbs)
  
# Choices
- Backspace and Enter where originaly on the left and right shift key (on strike, with tap-mod). This might have been faster to trigger than with the thumb, but les comfortable at use.
